## Discussion

Please study (*py4csds*) **book sections 15.1 through 15.3**. The sections presents a general introduction to two types of machine learning, supervised and unsupervised; followed by a walk-through of a case study of classification. The case applies **k-nearest neighbors** for identifying the digit in an image.

The discussion is purposed to help you understand the following aspects of machine learning:

-   Discuss two major types of machine learning: `supervised` and `unsupervised learning` in terms of learning output. Give each a couple of use cases.

-   Know the meaning of `target/label/class` and `attribute/feature` in machine learning. Give an example.

-   Describe the difference between `labeled data` and `unlabeled data`

-   Describe both required data set and output expected from a classification process for supervised learning

-   List the steps in a typical machine-learning project. Give each a brief description on the purpose of the step.

-   Describe the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. What is a lazy classifier/estimator? Why is an odd integer a better choice for number of neighbors in kNN estimators?

-   Discuss the purpose of `data split` in supervised learning, and list the sklearn functions for splitting data into training and test sets.

-   Describe the use of the popular Python libraries for machine learning: *Scikit-learn*, *Pandas*, *Matplotlib* and *Seaborn*.

-   Discuss how to represent an gray-scaled image in a numerical 2-dimensional array (a 2D matrix), and map the color intensity to the integers from the lowest for white to the darkest for black

-   Know the *matplotlib functions* for plotting a numerical 2-D array.

-   Describe the `k-fold cross validation` method for model selection

-   What are the hyperparameters of an estimator?

-   Will the prediction cost (in terms of execution time) increase as the k value increases in the kNN estimator?

-   Refer to [the Estimator Diagram](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html). List the estimator candidates which is suitable for classifying a labeled dataset over 100K and below 100K, respectively.

## Classification for Digit Recognition

The following is a snippet of only 12 lines. Take a look (you do not need to run it) and see how **sklearn** makes the classification easy to implement.

:::


## Steps

::: callout-important
### QUESTION: The steps in a typical machine-learning project

List the steps in a typical machine-learning project. Give each a brief description on the purpose of the step.
:::



## The digits Dataset

```{r echo=F}
knitr::include_url("https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_digits_last_image.html")
```

### Load data and check Type

sklearn stores its datasets in a Bunch object, specific to Sklearn. Each Bunch object contains several components storing values and metadata of the dataset.

```{python}
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
digits = load_digits()
print(type(digits))
```

### The features and target names

```{python}
print(digits.feature_names)
print(digits.target_names)
```

### The sample and target sizes

`digits.data` returns the samples. Each row is one sample. Each column in a given row represents one feature for that sample. `digits.target` returns the target values.

```{python}
# Data: number of rows, number of columns
print(digits.data.shape)
# target: one-dimensional array
print(digits.target.shape)
```

### View target

```{python}
# display the target values of every 50th sample
digits.target[::50] # Python slicing notation
```

### View a sample and its target value

Each sample is represented by a 8 by 8 2d-array. Each element/cell value is for one pixel, indicating the intensity in grayscale shades from 0 (white) to 16 (black).

```{python}
# 
digits.images[599]
```

```{python}
# the target of the sample
digits.target[599]
```

### Plot a digit sample image

Access a digit sample by its index. The index `-1` gets the last sample. Its target is 8 in `digits.target[-1]`.

```{python eval=T}
#| label: fig-digitsdataset
#| fig-cap: "The image of the last digit sample"

# stand-alone
from sklearn import datasets
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Load the digits dataset
digits = datasets.load_digits()
# Display the last digit
plt.figure(1, figsize=(3, 3))
plt.imshow(digits.images[-1], cmap=plt.cm.gray_r, interpolation="nearest")
plt.show()
#plt.savefig('imgs/digits_dataset_plot_image.png')
```

```{=html}
<!--
::: {.column-margin}
![The image of the last digit sample](imgs/digits_dataset_plot_image.png)
:::
-->
```
## Data Partition/Splitting

Read text 15.2.4 for splitting the Data for training and testing. Note that the random_state argument is set to an integer for reproducibility. As long as passing the same int to the split function, the function always returns the the same four subsets.

**X** denotes features/sample data, and **y** denotes target data.

```{python}
# digits has been loaded
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
  digits.data, digits.target, random_state=11)
```

By default, the split ratio is 75$\%$ for training and 25$\%$ for testing. To check the shape of `X_train` and `X_test`,

```{python}
print(X_train.shape)
print(X_test.shape)
```

To get a different split ratio, add either `test_size` or `train_size` to the function call:

```{python eval=F}
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
  digits.data, digits.target, random_state=11, test_size=0.3)
```

## Model Creating and Training

::: callout-important
### QUESTION: Lazy estimator & Odd Intergers for K value in kNN

Read 15.2.5 and 15.2.6. 

- What is a Lazy Estimator?
- Why is an odd integer a better choice for number of neighbors in kNN estimators?
:::



Calling the `KNeighborsClassifier` constructor without any argument will return an kNN estimator with the default setting. The number of neighbors $k$ in the `n_neighbors` parameter, defaults to **5**.

```{python results='hold'}
# Model training
# import the estimator
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
# create/instantiate a model named knn
knn = KNeighborsClassifier()
# Training the Model
knn.fit(X=X_train, y=y_train)
# print the estimator parameters
print(knn.get_params())
```

## Predicting Digit Classes

Read 15.2.7. Run the model with the test data `X_test`. Return the predictions in `predicted` . Compare `predicted` with the true labels in `y_test`. Get the accuracy percentage.

```{python}
# Predicting Digit Classes
predicted = knn.predict(X=X_test)
expected = y_test
```

Inspect the first 20 test samples for both prediction and expected values:

```{python }
print(f'Prediction: {predicted[:20]}')
print(f'Expected target: {expected[:20]}')
```

Compute the accuracy of the model by finding all the incorrect predictions:

```{python}
wrong = [ (p, e) for (p, e) in zip(predicted, expected) if p != e ]

print(f'Wrong predictions:\n{wrong}')
```

Get the accuracy percentage:

```{python}
( len(expected) - len(wrong) ) / len(expected)
```


## Evaluating the Estimator

Read 15.3.1 for the two evaluation methods: The **method `score`** and **confusion matrix**. ([The official documentation for model evaluation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html))


### Estimator method `score`

Each estimator object has a `score` method of evaluating the performance of the estimator for a given test data. The default score for classification estimators is the prediction accuracy for the test data. The `score` method expects two arguments for the test data and the expected target data.

```{python}
# score for k = 5
print(f'The knn score with 5 neighbors = {knn.score(X_test, y_test):.5f}')
```

### Confusion matrix

The following creates the confusion matrix for the knn estimator with two sets of labels: expected and predicted.

```{python}
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
confusion = confusion_matrix(y_true=expected, y_pred=predicted)
print(f'Confusion matrix with the test data:\n{confusion}')
```

A confusion matrix is a 2-dimensional, square matrix. Each row represents one distinct class/label. The digits data has ten distinct classes, the digits 0 through 9, and there are 10 rows in the matrix.

The *primary/principal diagonal* from top left to bottom right shows the correct predictions for each distinct class/label. The values on other positions are wrong predictions.

In each row, each column is the number of test cases which were classified into one distinct class.

For instance, the first row represents the digit 0 class. According to the first row of the confusion matrix,

```{python}
# first row of confusion matrix
confusion[0]
```

we know that all the 0 cases, 45 in total, have been classified as 0. With the test data, the estimator is capable of recognize all the 0 digits with the prediction accuracy being 100$%$.




### Classification Report

::: callout-important
### QUESTION: Define performance metrics

Define the metrics: precision, recall, f1-score, support
:::

The classification report lists several [classification metrics]() in a table. To get the report,

```{python}
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
names = [ str(digit) for digit in digits.target_names ]
report = classification_report(expected, predicted, target_names=names)
print(report)
```





### Visualize the confusion matrix

::: callout-important
### QUESTION: Heatmap visualization

A heatmap is a data visualization type where the individual values contained in a matrix through variations in coloring. What kind of data should you visualize in a heatmap?

:::

To visualize a 2D data in a heatmap, it requires two more libraries: **Pandas** and **Seaborn**.

> If the code in the text gives you multiple colormap bars, try the following code.

```{python eval=T, results='hold'}
#| label: fig-heatmap-confusion-matrix
#| fig-cap: "The heatmap of confusion matrix for a classification estimator"

# Visualize confusion matrix
import pandas as pd
confusion_df = pd.DataFrame(confusion, index=range(10),
     columns=range(10))

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.ticker import AutoMinorLocator

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
sns.heatmap(confusion_df, annot=True, cmap='nipy_spectral_r')
ax.minorticks_on()
ax.xaxis.set_minor_locator(AutoMinorLocator(2))
ax.yaxis.set_minor_locator(AutoMinorLocator(2))
ax.grid(linestyle = '--', which='minor')
plt.show()
#plt.savefig('imgs/heatmap_confusion_matrix.png')
```

```{=html}

```


## K-Fold Cross-Validation

::: callout-note

Read 15.3.2.

**K-fold cross-validation** is a model evaluation method for overcoming model overfitting issue from a small-sized sample dataset. The method is used in selecting one learning model among several candidates. The method makes well use of every sample in a small data set. Say you have a set of one hundred or no more than one thousand samples. Apply K-fold cross-validation to model evaluation. Split the data into k equally-sized **folds/subsets**. Repeat modeling for k times and rotate the test set over every subset. Take as the overall score, the average performance of k resulting estimators.
:::

**sklearn.model_selection** module provides the `KFold` class and `cross_val_score function`.

Shuffle the digits data (if data is ordered or grouped) and split the whole set into 10 equal-size folds. Run 10-fold cross-validation

```{python results='hold'}
'''KFold Cross-Validation'''
# 1. use the KFold Object. shuffle data and create 10 folds
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
kfold = KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=11, shuffle=True)

# 2. use the Function cross_val_score
# train knn with feature and target data
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(estimator=knn, X=digits.data, y=digits.target, cv=kfold)
# 3. Print 10 scores
print(scores)
```

Get the overall score by taking the mean of 10 scores:

```{python}
print(f'Mean accuracy of 5-nn estimators is {scores.mean():.3%}.')
```


## Model Selection

::: callout-note

Read 15.3.3.

Before performing the learning, the best estimator is unknown in any machine learning job. Need to train multiple models and choose **the best fit for a particular learning task**.

To compare three types of classification models: (all models are trained with default parameters in sklearn.)

1.  KNeighborsClassifier
2.  SVC (Support vector machine)
3.  GaussianNB (Naive Bayes)
:::


::: callout-tip

Due to a larger number of modeling repetitions, you would **expect a much longer execution time** than all the preceding ones. 

:::

```{python results='hold'}
'''Run multiple models. Select the best one.'''
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
# group three estimator argument values in a dictionary object
estimators = {
     'KNeighborsClassifier': knn, 
     'SVC': SVC(gamma='scale'),
     'GaussianNB': GaussianNB()}

for estimator_name, estimator_object in estimators.items():
     kfold = KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=11, shuffle=True)
     scores = cross_val_score(estimator=estimator_object, 
         X=digits.data, y=digits.target, cv=kfold)
     print(f'{estimator_name:>20}: ' + 
           f'mean accuracy={scores.mean():.2%}; ' +
           f'standard deviation={scores.std():.2%}')
```

The values in your output may be slightly different from the ones in the text. Text page 618 explains how to read the output and how to choose the best one according to the results.

> Both kNN and SVC can be computationally expensive and may not be the best fit for large data sets. Find the right model choices using the estimator diagram in the next part.


### Estimator diagram

A useful diagram for choosing the right type of estimator based on the three conditions: data type, data size and learning type.

```{r echo=F}
knitr::include_url("https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html")
```


## Hyperparameter Tuning


:::callout-important
### QUESTION: Hyperparamter

- What are the hyperparameters of an estimator?

- Will the prediction cost (in terms of execution time) increase as the k value increases in kNN estimator?

:::



Read 15.3.4.

Number of neighbors $k$ in a kNN estimator is a hyperparameter as $k$ must be predetermined/set to an integer before the model training step. Different k values produces kNN estimators of different performance. The hyperparameter tuning function in sklearn provides a search for the k value with the best prediction performance.

Pick a range for the k value, `range(1, 20, 2)`. The loop iterates over every k value and prints the mean accuracy of 10-fold cross validation per k value. You can find the k value with the highest accuracy.

However, be aware that a model with the highest accuracy is often not the best one when in real world, people always must take other cost terms into consideration, including the cost for execution time, hardware cost and model maintenance.

```{python results='hold'}
'''Hyperparameter Tuning: number of neighbors'''
for k in range(1, 20, 2):
     kfold = KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=11, shuffle=True)
     knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)
     scores = cross_val_score(estimator=knn, 
         X=digits.data, y=digits.target, cv=kfold)
     print(f'k={k:<2}; mean accuracy={scores.mean():.2%}; ' +
           f'standard deviation={scores.std():.2%}')
```
