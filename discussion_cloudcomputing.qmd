If you develop an AI product which is purposed to automate student advising service, keep track of individual student's progress, support real-time reporting, customize a course map per requirements, relieve the stress for both students and professors, and so on. The use of the product should not require extra operational cost and human resource. The ultimate goal of such a product is to help students customize individual course plan, complete the degree on time and fulfill their needs in career development.

Please share your thoughts and opinions on such kind of products, regardless the polarity of your view being positive, negative or neutral.

How would you justify incorporating AI being into the advising, instead of human being?
