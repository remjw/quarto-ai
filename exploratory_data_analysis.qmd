## Anscombe's quartet

Anscombe's quartet comprises four data sets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics, yet have very different distributions and appear very different when graphed. Each dataset consists of eleven `(x,y)` points. They were constructed in 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe to demonstrate both the **importance of graphing data** when analyzing it, and the effect of `outliers` and other influential observations on statistical properties [@noauthor_anscombes_2022].

He described the article as being intended to counter the impression among statisticians that *"numerical calculations are exact, but graphs are rough."*
