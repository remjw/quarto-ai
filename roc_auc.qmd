## Other Metrics

Depending on the problem at hand, you may have to optimize the classifier to improve selected metrics. For instance, in a medical diagnosis problem, it is very important to reduce FNR (false negative rate) and FPR (false positive rate).

### ROC & AUC

A **receiver operating characteristic** curve, or **ROC curve**, is a graph that plots the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier as its discrimination threshold is varied. The method was originally developed for operators of military radar receivers, which is why it is so named.

The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The `true-positive rate` is also known as `sensitivity`, `recall`. The `false-positive rate` is $$
FPR = \frac{FP}{TN+FP} = 1-specificity
$$
